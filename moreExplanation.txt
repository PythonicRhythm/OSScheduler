Question 1: do all the processes in the same level have the same priority
so its essentially FIFO in a way?
	- Essentially yes, the priority of the processes on the same level
	  are the same.

Question 2: in the output text for input-complex-CORRECT-OUTPUT, is the
reason that process 1583 keep dropping levels is because it meets its
quantum and then drops?
	- Didn't ask but self-explanatory, it is dropping because its
	  meeting the quantum.

Question 3: When the process is preempted, and it "keeps" its spot in
the queue, where does the process go that is higher priority? (the one that
preempted the other one.) Its in some sort of stasis?
	- This only happens because a higher level process arrives, so
	  both processes should keep their places, unless of course the
	  process that preempts the other, finished its whole quantum.

Keep in Mind: 
	I/O is one tick at a time. 
	When processes need I/O they are sent into a blocked queue. 

Question 4: Does processes that need I/O all get attention or is it
one at a time? EX: Blocked = [P1, P2, P3, P4] when io comes do they all get
a tick or is it one at a time FIFO?
	- Every process in the blocked queue does one tick of I/O when
	  its I/O time.

NOTES:

1) Make a separate method that checks if all queues are empty.
2) Understand when exactly the process writes a "QUEUED" message
   and other messages.
3) when a process does "bad" it means it uses the whole "quantum".
4) With the promotion and demotion counter.
5) View the document for set b, g and quantum for each level.
